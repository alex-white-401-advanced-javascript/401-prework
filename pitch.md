Throughout my life:  there have been two main motivating factors that push me forward: Building things is fun and helping people feels good.

I have always had a habit of taking things apart and figuring out what makes them tick. My parents always encouraged my curiosity even when they came home to 12 y/o me taking apart the TV and shocking myself. They constantly encouraged me to seek out and help others as well which is why I was involved in many volunteer organizations like the Boy Scouts.

During my time in the Marine Corps, these factors really started to mature and mesh together. After I participated in an initiative that had us create an application to help military families transition to an overseas assignment, I knew software development would be my ultimate goal.

After exiting the Marines 5 months ago I took the next towards that goal and am currently attending Code Fellows while also working on an evolving project time to introduce others, especially other veterans, to the world and culture of software.

My name is Alex White and I am a Software Developer working to change the world.
